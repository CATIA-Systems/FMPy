## Bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful, so thanks!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Validate your code** &mdash; ensure your
   problem isn't caused by a simple error in your own code.

2. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been
   reported.

3. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the
   latest `develop` branch in the repository.

4. **Isolate the problem** &mdash; ideally create a reduced test
   case and a live example.


Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is
your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue?

Example:

> Short and descriptive example bug report title
>
> A summary of the issue and the Python/OS environment in which it occurs. If
> suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.
>
> 1. This is the first step
> 2. This is the second step
> 3. Further steps, etc.
>
>
> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being
> reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as
> causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their
> merits).
