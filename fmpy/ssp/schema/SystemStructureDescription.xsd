            This is a draft schema proposal for the MAP-SSP SystemStructureDescription format and
            is subject to change at any time for any reason. Note that the target namespace is
            a placeholder and will change upon adoption.
            
            <!-- Rationale:
                 
                 The following definition of SSD and SSP file formats is intended to be a very
                 minimalistic exchange format for system structures consisting of potentially
                 nested sub-systems and components (either further systems described as separate
                 SSD/SSP files, or FMUs).
                 
                 The format is intended as an interchange format between different tools, not
                 as a replacement for tool-specific formats, and is focused on the exchange of
                 information on systems needed for their execution.  For the interchange of
                 architectural information on systems between architecture tools other formats
                 including more architectural information are likely more suited.
                 
                 The format tries to duplicate as little information as possible from any referenced
                 FMUs or SSD/SSP files, and tries to be agnostic as to the detailed semantics of the
                 connections being described, submitting to the semantics definitions of the relevant
                 standards for FMUs for actual connection semantics.  In this way the format should
                 be useful for many different purposes and should potentially be compatible with all
                 currently envisaged FMI standards.
                 
                 By defining both the basic system structure file format (SSD) and a format for
                 packaging the SSD and its related resources, including referenced SSDs/SSPs and FMUs
                 into an easily transportable archive (SSP), the proposal tries to offer flexibility
                 in the way system structure is being exchanged in different contexts, e.g. within
                 companies using PLM systems or between companies in a customer/supplier context.
                 
                 Besides the basic system structure, the proposal tries to offer a very basic
                 facility for handling multiple variants of a system topology efficiently, by
                 allowing multiple system structure descriptions to be present inside an SSP,
                 differing in topology but being able to reuse commonly shared resources like
                 sub-systems or FMUs.
                 
                 In the current draft only very basic optional layout information is included
                 in this file, in order to support further exploration of layout information
                 transfer.  It is proposed to optionally add layout information based on the
                 same mechanisms that are currently being discussed in the FMI MAP for graphical
                 layout information in FMUs, targeted for FMI 2.1 or later.  Since this is still a
                 work in progress, the final form for including layout information is still
                 to be defined.
            -->
            
            A system structure description (SSD) can be provided either as a stand-alone XML file,
            which will then have the file type ssd, e.g. MySystem.ssd, or as part of a system
            structure package (SSP), which is a ZIP archive (but with file type ssp) that will 
            contain the system structure definition as a file (SystemStructure.ssd) in the root
            of the ZIP archive hierarchy.  Any bundled FMUs or SSPs will be included in a resources
            directory, and are referenced by relative URI, see the description of the source attribute 
            of components below.
            
            <!-- Rationale:
                 
                 Both stand-alone SSD files just describing the topology of a system and SSP packages
                 packaging both SSD(s) and referenced component FMUs, SSD/SSPs and other resources
                 are defined in order to support use cases where there is need for loose coupling, e.g.
                 when FMUs and resources are supplied via PLM software or other repositories, as well
                 as use cases where a tight coupling for easier transportation or coherency requirements
                 is needed.
            -->
            
            Optionally an SSP archive can contain multiple SSD files in the root of the ZIP archive
            hierarchy, each with a different file name (e.g. SystemStructure.ssd, VarA.ssd, VarB.ssd).
            This allows the bundling of multiple variants of a system structure definition referencing
            a similar set of packaged resources as one SSP.  There must still be one SSD file named
            SystemStructure.ssd at the root of the ZIP archive which is deemed to be the default
            variant.  Tools not supporting variant-containing SSPs must deal with the given SSP by
            ignoring all contained SSD files except for the SystemStructure.ssd default file.
            
            <!-- Rationale:
                 
                 The ability to bundle multiple SSDs in one SSP is supposed to help use cases where
                 some form of limited bundling of multiple variants of a system structure is needed,
                 with at least some overlap in the set of referenced FMUs/SSDs/SSPs and other
                 resources.  In previous drafts this was implemented through a limited variant
                 mechanism inside of SSDs, but through further discussions it was deemed simpler
                 to move the variant-handling mechanism outside of SSDs.
            -->
            
            The directionality of connections is currently determined by the kind of the
            connectors being connected.  Since this draft only allows unidirectional kinds,
            all connections are directional.  In future draft and standard versions this might
            be changed to support connectors with more complex causalities, e.g. if proper acausal
            connectors are supported in the underlying FMI standards.

                                 Currently only FMUs, SSDs and SSPs can be referenced as components.
                                 A further possibility would be the ability to use a kind of template
                                 FMU, e.g. through MIME type application/x-ssp-fmu-template, which
                                 would be more or less a raw modelDescription.xml file which only
                                 defines the interface of an FMU, to be filled out at a later date
                                 with an actual FMU.
                                                     
                                 However this approach would yield a non-executable SSD/SSP, since no
                                 runnable FMU is present for this template.  It is likely simpler to
                                 just package a proper FMU with dummy behaviour in many cases, potentially
                                 with an attribute to indicate that this is a dummy.

                            the base URI is the URI of the SSD.  Therefore for components
                            that are located alongside the SSD, relative URIs without scheme
                            and authority can and should be used to specify the component

                            contains this SSD, this is mandatory (in this way, the SSD URIs

                            SSD should be selected, then the name of the non-default SSD must 
                            be given through a fragment identifier, i.e. the URI 
                            "resources/SubSSP.ssp#VariantB.ssd" would reference the VariantB.ssd
                            of SubSSP.ssp located in the resources directory relative to this SSD.

                                 SSP directly.  Since all SSDs of an SSP are constrained to be
                                 in the root directory of the archive, the character restrictions
                                 on fragment identifiers as per RFC 3986 are not violated.  We
                                 should however make clear in a standard pre-amble that all names
                                 in the ZIP archive are constrained to only contain certain
                                 characters.

                            When the URI is a same-document URI with a fragment identifier, e.g.
                            "#other-system", then the fragment identifier should identify a
                            system element in this SSD document with an id attribute identical
                            to the fragment identifier.  This mechanism can be used to instantiate
                            an embedded system definition multiple times through reference to
                            its definition element.

                                 This allows re-use of embedded system definitions, so that those
                                 do not have to be packaged as separate SSPs/SSDs just to reuse
                                 the definition.

                            Note that implementations are only required to support relative URIs
                            as specified above, and that especially relative URIs that move beyond
                            the baseURI (e.g. go "up" a level via ..) are not required to be
                            supported by implementations, and are in fact often not supported for
                            security or other reasons.  Implementations are also not required to
                            support any absolute URIs and any specific URI schemes (but are of
                            course allowed to support any and all kinds of URIs where useful).

                                                (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) define the positions of the lower-left and upper-right

                                                is that the text is automatically sized ad wrapped in such a way that it
                                                fits the note area.  If this would lead to too small text, it might be
                                                necessary to provide an interactive method (like expanding triangle, or popup,
                                                or other means) to show the remainder of the note text.  Inside the text

                                variability of the variable must be discrete or continuous (for

                                of kind parameter the causality must be input or internal and the
                                variablity must be parameter.  For connectors of kind

                                additionally be 'inout', which indicates that the semantics of the
                                connector are derived from the connections going to the connector.
                                This can be used for example to allow a connector to function as
                                both an input and output within the same SignaleDictionaryReference.

                        This provides a parameter binding for a component or system.  For FMU components 
                        this allows the parametrization of the FMU's parameters with a parameter source
                        (e.g. a parameter file).  Note that in this case the names provided in the parameter
                        source must match the names of the FMU parameters, or must be mapped to the
                        names of the FMU parameters through a ParameterMapping element.
                        
                        For systems the names in the parameter source must either match the hierarchical
                        names of parameters in the system, or must be mapped to those names through a
                        ParameterMapping element.
                        
                        The hierarchical names of the parameters of a system are formed in the following way:
                        Any parameters of the system exposed through connectors of the system have the name
                        of the connector as their name.  For all elements of the system, the hierarchical names
                        of the parameters of those elements are formed by prepending the element name and a dot
                        to the hierarchical names of the parameters in that element.  E.g. for a system A containing
                        a system B which contains an exposed parameter named SP1 and an element C with a
                        parameter P2, the hierarchical names of the parameters in system A are B.SP1 and B.C.P2
                        respectively.  The hierarchical name of those parameters inside system B are SP1 and C.P2
                        respectively.
                        
                        More than one ParameterBinding can be supplied, in which case all of the parameters
                        found will be used to parametrize the component, with parameter values in later
                        ParameterBinding sources taking priority over earlier sources, should a parameter be
                        included in more than one ParameterBinding source.
                        
                        When ParameterBindings on multiple levels of the hierarchy supply values for the same
                        parameter, bindings at a higher hierarchy level take precedence over lower levels, i.e.
                        bindings at a system level take precedence over bindings at a sub-system or component
                        level.

                        Parameter bindings for FMU components can be used to set any initial values in the
                        FMU which are legal to change.  It is assumed that the parameterization is applied
                        prior to initializing for FMI 1.0, or before entering initialization mode for FMI 2.0.
                        This means that variables eligible for parameterization are those with:
                          * either causality = "input" or a start value for FMI 1.0
                          * variability != "constant" and initial = "exact" or "approx" for FMI 2.0

                        All kinds of system connectors can be parameterized.  In case the system level connectors
                        are connected to FMU components, the parameterization must be compatible with the variable
                        in the connected FMU.

                        <!-- Rationale:
                            
                             Allowing parameter bindings to set all start values makes them more disctinct from
                             parameter connections. The movitation for this is that the parameter bindings
                             define the initial values of the system, while parameter connections can be
                             used to propagate calculated and/or tunable parameters during both simulation and
                             initialization.

                             An alternative would be to allow parameter connections to be made to any connector
                             that can be parameterized by parameter binding, but this would complicate the
                             definition of which connections are legal. Especially, it would make it possible
                             to chain connectors, e.g connecting a parameter to a system input to set the start
                             value and then connecting the input to a component.
                             -->
                        
                        ParameterBindings that apply to a component that references another SSD/SSP are handled
                        as if the top-level system of the SSD/SSP was present in the enclosing system instead of
                        the component with one special case: Any parameter bindings in the component are treated
                        as if they were present in the top-level system of the SSP/SSD after all parameter bindings
                        of the system.  Therefore they take priority over any of the existing parameter bindings
                        (for parameters with identical names).

                        <!-- Rationale:
                             
                             This is a very basic way of parametrizing components and systems, without yet 
                             addressing the parametrization of non-FMU components, which is still under
                             ongoing discussion. However this approach already gives the potential to correctly
                             parametrize a complete system.  Combined with the basic variant handling approach, this
                             provides the ability to handle variant parametrization as well, and by using multiple
                             parameter bindings per component parametrization can be built up from parts.
                             
                             Still this area is very likely to undergo further changes based upon
                             further discussions and experience inside the MAP SSP working group.

                                one element of the system by supplying the name of the element plus a dot
                                as a prefix on the binding, thus causing all parameter names in the parameter
                                set to be treated as if they were specified with proper hierarchical names.
